## How to contribute with code

### Getting started

- Fork the repo
- Clone your fork
- Install the packages: `yarn install`
- Run the demo: `yarn develop`

To be able to have both the demo and plugin in the same repo we use [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).

- Plugin code is in the `/plugin` folder,
- and the demo code is in the `/demo` folder.

### Do your thing

Solve an [issue](https://github.com/queen-raae/gatsby-plugin-let-it-snow/issues) or do something else!

### Create a Pull Request

To get your changes merged into the project create a Pull Request from your fork.
